Here we discuss CNNs in 1d

We define an input 1d column matrix called as feature vector
and another column matrix filter/weights. 

The result is another column matrix we define it to be Feature Map.

For each element fm_i, in feature map, at index i, we can write 

fm_i = sum ( fv_j * w_k )
in shorter terms fm = fv * w (convolution)

j varying over i and i + w.size
and 
k varying over 0 and w.size

This defines single layer convolution, that is a non deep CNN

however if we talk about multiple layers we take the feature map of one layer 
as the feature vector for the next layer and a maybe different filter/weights 
column vector. The same can go on for a few layers.

A possible reference image on the multiple layer CNN.
